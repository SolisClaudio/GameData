        "message": "Hello, this is John Carter again. I’m calling because your response to my issue was completely off the mark. You told me it was probably just leftover debris from the rain, maybe something like wet leaves or trash that got blown in. Well, guess what? After the latest rainstorm, those spoon-like things were back, and this time, one of them actually crawled toward me when I approached. It was definitely alive, not some inanimate debris like you said. I don’t know what these things are, but they’re getting bolder, and your advice has been useless. I need real help, not dismissive guesses!",

      "message": "Hi, this is John Carter. I'm calling about a really odd situation in my yard. After every rainstorm, I find these shiny, spoon-like objects scattered around. At first, I thought it was debris, but when I tried picking one up, it wriggled slightly, like it was alive. They seem to cluster near the flowerbeds and disappear after a few hours, leaving no trace. My neighbors haven't seen anything similar, and I'm starting to think I'm imagining it. Could you help me figure out what's going on?",

      "message" : "Hello, I'm Rigoberta Menchú. I have a peculiar issue at home. I keep finding cactus plants in places where I know I didn't put them. It started with one in my garage, then another in the bathroom. Last night, I woke up to find a small cactus on my nightstand that wasn't there before. These aren't my plants—they're slightly different, with unusual spines that seem to shift direction when I look away. It's unsettling, and I don't know how they're appearing. What could this mean?",

        "message": "Hello, Claudio Solis again. I’m calling because your advice about the strange shapes in my living room was completely useless. You told me it might just be drafts or dust particles reflecting the dim light, but last night, it got worse. Those 'trails of smoke' you dismissed? They were swirling around like they had some sort of purpose, and I swear I felt something brush against my arm. Turning on the light didn’t make them disappear as quickly this time. I trusted your expertise, but now I’m stuck in a house that feels like it’s turning against me. What kind of service is this?",

      "message": "Good afternoon, this is Claudio Solis. I've noticed something eerie in my living room over the past few nights. When the lights are dim, I see faint shapes moving through the air, like trails of dense smoke, but they don't dissipate. They linger, and when I approach, the air feels colder in those spots. Once, I thought I saw a hand-like form reaching toward me before it dissolved when I turned on a lamp. There's no smell of smoke or fire, and nothing seems damaged, but it's unnerving. Should I be concerned?",

I end up finding them hidden under the couch, clustered together, almost like they've been dragged there. Some of the toys, especially the softer ones, have tiny bite marks on them. I don't have pets, and there's no sign of mice. It's as if the toys are moving on their own or being taken. Is there an explanation for this?",
