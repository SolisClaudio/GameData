      "message": "Hello, good morning. My name is Grace Johnson, and I am leaving this message because I have noticed something disturbing in my house. During the nights, I hear noises like something scratching inside the walls, especially in the kitchen. This morning I found small black pellets in the pantry and a nibbled cereal packet. There is also a strange smell near the cabinets, like something rancid. Please, I need guidance on what to do before this gets worse. Thank you.",

Every time I turn on the kitchen light at night, I see something small and fast running towards the corners or under the sink. I have also found food scraps with small holes and an unpleasant smell near the garbage disposal. I don't know how to get rid of them, and they seem to be increasing. I hope you can help me. Thank you.",

Upon closer inspection, I noticed that the wood looks like it is hollow in some places, and there are some tiny tunnels in the walls. I also saw small winged insects near the lights a couple of days ago. Please, I need guidance to resolve this before it gets worse.",

They are not very big, but I have found some webs in dark corners and behind furniture that I don't move often. I'm a little scared because I've seen them closer to my bed and sometimes I see one or two walking along the walls. what should I do? Thank you.",

In the last few days, I have been feeling a musty smell, especially in the bathroom and basement. I have checked and noticed that some walls have black stains, as if they were dirty, and the paint is peeling in some areas. I have also seen some small bubbles on the walls. I'm quite worried because I don't know if this could be dangerous. what should I do?",
