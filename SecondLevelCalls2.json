        "message": "Hello, this is Julia Martin again. I need to express my frustration. You told me the distorted echoes were probably due to irregular room acoustics and suggested some soundproofing fixes, but things have gotten even stranger. The whispers have become more distinct, and now they don't just repeat what I say—they respond. Just last night, I heard a voice say, 'We see you,' when I wasn’t even talking. I followed your advice, but it’s clear this is not a simple acoustic issue. Your response missed the mark entirely, and now I’m feeling even more unsettled in my own home. This is not okay!",

      "message": "Hello, this is Julia Martin. I'm experiencing something very odd in my home. Whenever I speak in certain rooms, particularly the hallway and the study, my words echo back in a distorted way. It doesn't happen anywhere else, and it feels like the echo takes on a tone I didn't use. Sometimes, I hear fragments of words or whispers that don't match anything I said. Yesterday, I heard my name whispered back to me, but I was home alone. I don't know if it's the acoustics or something else. Can you help me understand what's happening?",

      "message" : "Hi, this is Noelia Pompa. I've noticed something peculiar with my child's toys. The softer toys, like stuffed animals, keep disappearing from their usual spots, and I've found a pile of them under the bed. What's strange is that they seem to have small tears or bite marks, as if something has been nibbling on them. It's creepy because I know we don't have pets, and there's no sign of rodents. Could it be something unusual?",

The air feels unusually damp, and there's a persistent smell that's hard to describe—it's not quite bad, but definitely noticeable. There are some dark patches forming on the walls and ceiling, but they're not spreading evenly, and they feel different to the touch. I don't know if this is something normal or if I should be concerned. Can you help me figure it out?",

        "message": "Hello, this is Amanda Reyes. I have to say, I’m extremely frustrated with the way you handled my issue. You said it was just a trick of the light and suggested I change my lightbulbs, but last night, things got worse. Those shadowy trails didn’t just move—they seemed to cluster in the corners of the room. It felt like they were watching me. This is no lighting issue, and your dismissal of my concerns has left me feeling unsafe in my own home. I trusted you to take this seriously, and you clearly didn’t.",

When I dim the lights, faint shadowy trails move across the walls, but there's no source of smoke or anything burning. It's almost like figures forming and then fading away when I turn the lights back on. It's unsettling. Do you think this could be a sign of something serious?",
