    "description": "Mice are small rodents that infiltrate homes looking for food, water and shelter. They are nocturnal, so it is common to find them active during the night. They often leave traces such as feces, footprints or gnaw marks on walls, furniture and stored food. They are also extremely agile, capable of squeezing through spaces as small as the diameter of a pencil.",
    "danger": "Mice not only damage materials such as wood and electrical wiring, but also carry serious diseases such as hantavirus, salmonellosis and leptospirosis. Their droppings and urine can contaminate food and preparation surfaces. In addition, gnawed cables pose a risk of short circuits and fires.",
    "solution": "To control mice, inspect and seal any cracks or holes in the home using caulk or steel grates, store food in airtight containers and clean up crumbs regularly. Place mechanical or glue traps near walls where mice roam and, if the infestation persists, contact a professional exterminator for a comprehensive solution."

    "description": "Bees are flying insects that play a vital role in pollination, but in the home context they can become a dangerous pest. They are attracted to flowers, fruits and sweet foods. When they find a suitable place to form their hive, such as in wall voids, roofs or garages, they may settle in or around the home. Bees are usually harmless if they do not feel threatened, but can be very aggressive if they sense danger.",
    "danger": "The main danger of bees in the home is their ability to sting. Although bees are not aggressive by nature, they defend themselves fiercely if their hive is in danger. Stings can cause severe allergic reactions, including anaphylaxis, in sensitive individuals. In addition, bees can form large swarms, increasing the risk of multiple stings. If the hives are located in hard-to-reach places, the removal process can be dangerous. The accumulation of bees can also damage household structures due to the moisture they create, especially if the hives are in sealed areas.",
    "solution": "The solution to controlling a bee infestation in the home must be handled carefully. First, potential entrances, such as cracks or openings in walls, should be identified and sealed. If a hive is discovered, it is best to contact a professional beekeeper or pest control expert who can safely relocate the bees, as bees are beneficial to the environment. Never attempt to remove a hive on your own without the necessary expertise, as this can be dangerous. If it is a sting, it is recommended to apply ice to the affected area and seek medical attention if the reaction is severe. In addition, avoiding wearing perfumes or colorful clothing may help reduce the likelihood of attracting bees."

    "description": "Termites are social insects that work in colonies, feeding primarily on cellulose, which is found in wood. They can go unnoticed for months, as they often begin their damage from inside wood structures. Common signs include mud tunnels in walls, hollow wood when tapped, and the presence of winged termites (swarmers) near windows or doors.",
    "danger": "If not detected in time, termites can compromise the stability of furniture, beams, door frames and other wooden structures. Not only does this cost a lot of money in repairs, but it also puts the safety of the home's occupants at risk.",
    "solution": "Conduct periodic visual inspections for signs such as mud tunnels and hollow wood, apply repellent products on wood bases and use physical barriers on foundations. Set up baited stations to control colonies and, in the event of an active infestation, contact professionals who employ methods such as fumigation or heat treatments."

    "description": "Cockroaches are nocturnal insects that usually inhabit kitchens, bathrooms and basements, feeding on food scraps, paper, cardboard and garbage. They can survive in extreme conditions and reproduce rapidly, making them difficult to control.",
    "danger": "They pose a serious threat to human health by spreading bacteria, viruses and allergens. Their presence can cause diseases such as salmonellosis, gastrointestinal infections and respiratory allergies due to their droppings and molted skin.",
    "solution": "To eliminate cockroaches, meticulously clean kitchen and bathroom areas to remove food debris and moisture. Seal cracks and holes in walls, floors and furniture, place glue traps and apply gel baits in strategic areas. If the infestation is severe, hire a professional fumigation service to ensure complete eradication."

    "description": "Mold is a type of fungus that grows in damp, warm, poorly ventilated areas inside the home. It usually appears in bathrooms, kitchens, basements and leaky roofs, manifesting as black, green or white spots accompanied by a distinctive musty odor.",
    "danger": "Exposure to mold can cause respiratory problems such as asthma, allergies, eye and skin irritation, and, in severe cases, lung infections, especially in people with weakened immune systems. In addition, mold can weaken household structures and damage furniture or clothing exposed to prolonged mold growth.",
    "solution": "Clean affected areas with a solution of water and vinegar or bleach. Improve home ventilation by installing exhaust fans or opening windows regularly, repair water leaks in roofs and pipes, and use dehumidifiers to reduce humidity. If mold has infested large or structural areas, contact mold removal specialists to avoid complications and ensure proper remediation."
