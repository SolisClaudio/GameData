Upon checking, I found a small group of them going in and out of a hole in the side of my house. I'm worried they might sting someone, and I don't know how to handle this safely. Please help!",

I've also noticed tiny black droppings in the pantry and some chewed corners on food packaging. There's a strange, musky smell in certain areas of the kitchen. Can you advise me on what to do?",

There are tiny brown marks around the sink area, and I've noticed a faint, unpleasant smell in the corners of the cabinets. I'm concerned this might get worse. Can you provide some advice?",

I've noticed that some of the paint on my walls has started to crack in thin, jagged lines. At first, I thought it was just wear and tear, but now there are tiny pinholes in the paint and some faint, hollow sounds when I tap on certain areas of the walls. There's also a fine powdery substance on the floor near the baseboards that I can't figure out. What could this be?",
