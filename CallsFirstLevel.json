The paint is bubbling, and I feel the air is damp in that area. Iâ€™m worried this might affect my health. Could you guide me on what steps to take?",

Every time I turn on the kitchen light at night, I see something small and fast running towards the corners or under the sink. I have also found food scraps with small holes and an unpleasant smell near the garbage disposal. I don't know how to get rid of them, and they seem to be increasing. I hope you can help me. Thank you.",

Upon closer inspection, I noticed that the wood looks like it is hollow in some places, and there are some tiny tunnels in the walls. I also saw small winged insects near the lights a couple of days ago. Please, I need guidance to resolve this before it gets worse.",
