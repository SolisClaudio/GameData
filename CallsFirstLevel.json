Every time I turn on the kitchen light at night, I see something small and fast running towards the corners or under the sink. I have also found food scraps with small holes and an unpleasant smell near the garbage disposal. I don't know how to get rid of them, and they seem to be increasing. I hope you can help me.

Upon closer inspection, I noticed that the wood looks like it is hollow in some places, and there are some tiny tunnels in the walls. I also saw small winged insects near the lights a couple of days ago. Please, I need guidance to resolve this before it gets worse.",

I've noticed that some of the paint on my walls has started to crack in thin, jagged lines. At first, I thought it was just wear and tear, but now there are tiny pinholes in the paint and some faint, hollow sounds when I tap on certain areas of the walls. There's also a fine powdery substance on the floor near the baseboards that I can't figure out. What could this be?",
